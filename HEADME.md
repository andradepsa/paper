Project Summary for Zenodo
Abstract:

The Advanced Scientific Paper Generator is a sophisticated, AI-powered web application that fully automates the scientific publication workflow. Built on Google's powerful Gemini models, this tool seamlessly guides users from initial concept to a published paper with a registered DOI. The process starts by generating a compelling, high-impact research title from a selected topic. It then composes a complete, multi-page scientific paper in valid LaTeX, featuring an abstract, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion, and a bibliography grounded with real-world sources via Google Search.

The application's core strength lies in its rigorous, multi-iteration quality assurance system. Each draft undergoes a comprehensive evaluation against 28 distinct academic and technical metrics. The AI then intelligently refines the LaTeX source code to correct flaws and elevate the paper's quality, ensuring high standards of academic integrity. Finally, the polished LaTeX is compiled into a PDF and can be published directly to Zenodo through its API, completing a fully automated research-to-publication pipeline.

Instructions for Reuse and Customization:

This application is openly available for adaptation by the research community. To configure the software for publishing under your name, please follow these steps:

1.  **Configure API Keys:** The application requires a Google Gemini API Key and a Zenodo Personal Access Token. Both can be securely stored within the application's settings (⚙️ icon).
2.  **Update Author Information:** To ensure correct attribution, you must modify the author's name, affiliation, and ORCID number directly in the application's source code.

For detailed guidance on source code modification and deployment, please refer to the complete `README.md` file in the project repository.
