    <!-- 
      IMPORTANT FOR CLOUDFLARE PAGES (AND SIMILAR HOSTING):
      The "Failed to load module script" and "application/octet-stream" errors indicate that
      your hosting environment is trying to serve the raw `index.tsx` (TypeScript) file directly,
      instead of the transpiled JavaScript bundle produced by Vite.

      To fix this, you MUST configure Cloudflare Pages (or your chosen host) to:
      1.  **Run the Build Command:** `npm run build`
      2.  **Serve the Output Directory:** `dist` (this is where Vite places the compiled JavaScript and the rewritten index.html)

      The `src="/index.tsx"` below is the correct reference for Vite's development server.
      During the `npm run build` process, Vite will automatically transform this
      `index.html` in the `dist` folder to point to the correct, transpiled,
      and hashed JavaScript bundle (e.g., `/assets/index-xxxxxxxx.js`).

      If you still see a blank page or errors in the browser's console after
      ensuring these Cloudflare Pages settings, please provide the full
      console output and network tab errors.
