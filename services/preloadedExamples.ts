The classical isoperimetric problem, which seeks to characterize shapes that enclose a maximal volume for a given surface area, is extended from Euclidean and Riemannian settings to non-smooth spaces equipped with a distance and a measure. We focus on metric-measure spaces satisfying the Ricci curvature-dimension condition, RCD(K,N), which provides a synthetic notion of having Ricci curvature bounded from below by K and dimension bounded above by N. The primary result is an exposition of the Lévy-Gromov isoperimetric inequality in this framework, which states that the isoperimetric profile of an RCD(K,N) space is bounded below by that of a canonical model space of constant curvature. We further explore the rigidity associated with this inequality. When the isoperimetric profile of a space with positive curvature lower bound matches that of the model space for some volume, the space must exhibit a specific geometric structure, often a suspension over another metric-measure space. This rigidity phenomenon implies that the model spaces (e.g., spheres) are the unique extremal shapes for the volume-surface relation under these curvature constraints. The analysis relies on tools from optimal transport and the theory of non-smooth curvature, providing a unified perspective on isoperimetric problems---
